## Mathematical Analysis

During this course I gained deep understanding of the fundamental concepts of
mathematical analysis, including limits, derivatives, integrals, series, it goes
on.. . The rigorous training helped me develop strong analytical and
problem-solving skills, which are essential for any advanced study in
mathematics and its applications in programming. The course projects and
assignments also improved my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical
problems.

## Linear Algebra

The Linear Algebra course was pivotal in understanding vector spaces, linear
transformations, and matrix theory. This knowledge is crucial for fields such as
computer graphics, machine learning, and systems theory. Through this course, I
enhanced my computational skills and learned how to approach and solve complex
problems systematically.

## Optimisation algorithms

In this course, I learned and implemented various optimization methods,
including `genetic algorithms` and techniques for solving the
`traveling salesman problem` and `transport network` optimization problems. This
hands-on experience with optimization algorithms greatly enhanced my programming
skills in Rust and Python and my understanding of efficient algorithm design.
Hopefully it would help me in developing my own neural networks and solving
practical transportation problems in the future.
